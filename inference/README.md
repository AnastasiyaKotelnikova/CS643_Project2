# Inference

This folder will contain the code for running model inference.

Files to be added:
- inference.py – script to load trained model and make predictions
- test_input.json or sample_data.csv – test inputs for inference
- requirements.txt – dependencies for inference runtime

Purpose:
Test model inference locally or using AWS (EC2 / Docker) and return predictions.
